        I am majoring in Business Administration and intending to concentrate in Finance or Marketing<br><br>

         I always feel that the business field is boundless, with learning opportunities in every area of the field. The dynamics of the modern market keep evolving, concerning the new trends in business and developments in technology. Belonging to a family of entrepreneurs, I was always sure to tread the same path.  My father is a businessman and a role model to me. From the very beginning, I wanted to start my own business and wanted to prove my worth.  I have always been fascinated to know how the trade cycles work and how economic development takes place. From a very young age, I have developed the habit of reading newspapers every morning and staying updated with current affairs and global economic scenarios. The advancement in technology and the path on which it has led the world, has inspired me strongly to pursue my studies in business. This curiosity to learn about marketing, management, finance, economics, and trade made me interested in pursuing BBA in my undergrad program. To reach perfection at its peak, it is utmost necessary that I consider studying at your university with its rewarding studying programs in various fields of business, along with a highly suitable environment. For the past one and a half years, I got the opportunity to learn the subjects like Statistics, Accounts, Economics, and the Organisation of Commerce and Management, which helped me understand the first principles of the business field. Moreover, I got more motivation and interest in the subjects, about which I was always passionate. This academic experience has provided me with a wide range of theoretical knowledge and practical skills that will be immensely useful when studying at the undergraduate level. I feel like I can perform in high-level competitions for companies because of my internal drive and passion. Having skills like Time management, Leadership, Handling pressure, Decision making, Working in a group, Organizational skills, Active listening, Planning, Communication, Public speaking, Problem-solving, Creative thinking, Strategy and development, Mentoring, and Self-confidence, I can provide a company with tons of things and help them and myself to climb on top of the competition. I always dreamt of working as a financial manager for a renowned company. The job positions are not limited, but I have some prefrence because I want to make sure that what I do is making me happy and proud.  Time is the key factor in business. No person would start a business and wake up as a millionaire the other day. I want to devote all my possible time to understand the system and market globally. Once, when I would be confident and knowledge full enough, I would like to start my own business. That's my dream, my goal, my hobby, my love, and almost everything a person wants in life. For now, my first goal is to get an internship, which would help me to start my professional career in a small but efficient way.
